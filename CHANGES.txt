April 2010 update 0.9
-------------------------------------------------
This is a major update. It's advised you cleanup your old DATA_ROOT and run
indexing from fresh. Also the web application should be replaced, since new
indexes are not compatible with old application.
This is also a general rule for most of opengrok updates. We don't really
support backwards compatibility, unless it would be a really minor update.

New Features:

faster lucene engine(3.0.1) underneath - faster analyzers
new jquery(1.4.2) underneath - UI improvements
support for xrefs with Unicode characters(not indexed yet, but finally viewable!)
new smf service - just pass the source root, the rest is taken care by the service(Solaris)

Bugs fixed:

Bug #13280: RFE: Configurable tab size for xref
Bug #13362: plainanalyzer xref writer can never end for a file with long lines

We'd like to thank all the people that report bugs, send us ideas and
improvements. Below are just people that sent patches or pushed code, that
doesn't mean that we don't appreciate your work. On the contrary, you are
the people showing other people(who have the time to write code) what would
be good to fix when you use this software and file bugs against it!

doesn't necessarily reflect how significant each change was. (inspect the
history log with "hg log -v -r 0.8.1:tip" to get all details)

October 2008 update 0.7
-------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES

* Support more source code repository backends:
   o ClearCase (Magnus Lind)
   o Git (Jorgen Austvik)
   o Razor (Peter Bray)

* JMX Agent (Jan Stale Berg)

OpenGrok can now talk JMX with clients. This work is the start of a 
project to make it easier to configure OpenGrok. The first proof of 
concept is a system tray applet to show OpenGrok status.

* Use external Subversion binary instead of svn-javahl.jar (Trond)

A lot of our users had problems installing svn-javahl.jar, now we use 
the system provided svn binary.

* Logging

OpenGrok is changed to use standard java.util.logging (Jan Stale Berg, 
Trond, Lubos Kosco)

* Store history cache in compressed files to save disk space (Trond)

* Quality (Trond, Knut Anders, Lubos Kosco, Jorgen Austvik)
   - We have incorporated tools like PMD, FindBugs, CheckStyle and 
Hudson into our development process, and fixed lots and lots of 
potential bugs long before any users experience them.
   - We have started to write unit-tests, and use Emma to measure how 
good they are. In this release our unit tests cover 61% of our code 
(block coverage), for OpenGrok 0.8 we aim for 70%.

* General code and design cleanup (Peter Bray, Trond, Knut Anders, Lubos 
Kosco, Jorgen Austvik)
